## Part 2: Linking rule $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)
Explain that the rule indicates the target depends on the object files; when any object changes, the target is rebuilt. When linking against a library, you pass `-L` and `-l` and the linker searches archives/shared objects rather than linking each object directly.

## What is a git tag...
Annotated vs lightweight: annotated stores metadata and signed comment; lightweight is just a name pointing to a commit.

## Purpose of Release on GitHub
To provide downloadable binaries (lib and executables) and a snapshot for graders.

[Add the rest: Part 3 & Part 4 questions explained: ar/ranlib, PIC, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, nm output and static vs dynamic symbol presence.]
